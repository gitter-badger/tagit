# The underscores (_) before a key indicates that the word is not used in the beginning of a sentence
# and thus is not capitalized in most languages, but might be capitalized in some (e.g. the name of a month, a noun in German, etc.)
# The _verb suffix represents an English word that is a verb, but at the same time a noun. This is usually not the case in other languages.
